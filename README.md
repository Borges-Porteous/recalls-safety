# recalls-safety
## Repo for Recalls and Safety optimization protoyping project 
A collaboration between TBS Digital Transformation Office, Health Canada, CFIA, Transport, Environment Canada

This prototyping space will hold exploratory versions of Recalls and search/filter tools to improve citizen success. An initial round of task-scenario testing on the live version of RSAMS (Recalls Safety Alerts Message System) highlighted critical usability problems that we aim to improve in these prototypes of a potential new design. A second round of testing with Canadian participants on their smartphones will take place in mid-June 2018. 

This page of links to ideas we are exploring will eventually link to scenarios for the test participants:

See Australia's Recalls site for the model we are working towards (with some improvements!) of a search-filtering system with simplified templates for the recalls:
